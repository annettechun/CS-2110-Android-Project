# CS-2110-Android-Project
Software Development Methods

Ghost Hunter
Your task is to develop a game for the Android… let your creativity run wild…!

Project Manager should ask “(how) does this fit into our product?”
Software Architect should ask “(how) will this fit into our code design?”
User Interface Designer should ask “(how) will the user see this?”
Quality Assurance Manager should ask “(how) do we know it doesn't break something?”
Note, a person as responsibility to see X is done well (X is one of the roles above), NOT that this person does all of X. Everyone codes! If your team consists of 5 members, two people can take on the same role (but not the Project Manager role - only one person should be responsible for this role.) If your team consists of 3 members, one person should take on two roles.

Required Functionality
Have a splash screen noting at least
All teammate names
The university (University of Virginia), course (CS 2110), and semester (Fall 2014)
Some kind of identifying logo, image, or name
If someone gave you unusually major assistance, acknowledge them too
See the user/character on the screen (relative location to onscreen elements) and see the user/character move. Suggestions on implementing movement are as follows (this is by no means a complete list):
Buttons (e.g. up, down, left, right) to move the user/character
Use the android accelerometer (tilting to move the user/character)
Use touch (touching the screen or draging your finger across the screen to cause movement)
(Do NOT use the GPS feature with Google maps! Try to find alternative ways to implement movement)
Auto-generate ghosts at locations relatively near the user
note: this does not mean the ghosts then dynamically move after being spawned. If you want this functionality see the "move" optional item below)
Have a view of the world (e.g. a room, some scenery, dungeon, …) where the user and ghosts are both seen on screen relative to one another
note: this does not need to have a map background; user + ghost on a blank background is fine
Have some technique for "killing" ghosts
Keep track of some sort of progress statistics (points, number of kills, etc.)
and be able to display that information
Optional Functionality and Product Grading
There are many possible games you can make within these constraints. Maybe yours is all about running around faster than the ghosts; maybe it's more of a scavenger hunt trying to find how to vanquish each ghost; maybe it's about tricking or trapping or otherwise disabling them. The details are up to you.
